Adjust the web page to any possible screen size

Useable on all devices

Set of best practices:

1. Fluid layouts
  - allows webapge to adapt to the current viewports
  - Use % (or vh/vw) instead of px
  - use max-width instead of width
  - Flexbox and CSS-Grid are fluid by default

2. Responsive Units
  - Use rem instead of px
  - scale the entire page down automatically
  - TIP: set 1 rem = 10px for easy calculation

3. Flexible Images
  - Images do not scale automatically
  - Always use % for image dimensions, together with max-width property

4. Media Queries
  - Bring responsive sites to life
  - To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)


Desktop First vs Mobile First

Desktop First:
- Start writing CSS for the desktop: large screen
- Then, media queries shrink the design for smaller screens

Mobile First:
- Start writing CSS for mobile devices: small screens 
- Media queries expand the design
- Forces us to reduce websites to the absolute essentials
